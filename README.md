# Reinforcement Learning Project: Atari AirRaid with A2C

## Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning model using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to solve the Atari AirRaid environment. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) policy for learning and playing the game.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Gymnasium
- Pytorch
- Stable Baselines3

Install these dependencies
The training logs are present in the repository.
